# Janssen ETL Documentation

This guide is meant to show the process by which data licensed by Janssen Research & Development was converted to the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel).

* [Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)](https://ohdsi.github.io/ETL-LambdaBuilder/CPRD) 

The below image illustrates how each Synthea table was mapped to its corresponding OMOP CDM table(s). Some of the native tables were mapped to more than one CDM table and that is largely due to vocabulary and domain movement.
